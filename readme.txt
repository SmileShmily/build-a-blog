I wrote all of python code and HTML templates and of the css . This code is slightly different than my first attempt at each homework because I often incorporated elements  after finishing the homework.

Created a Blog site using Python, Jinja Framework and Google App Engine.
  Users can sign up, login and create posts public to other users.

- Implemented my own sign in and login and used to create an 
  encryption to protect user passwords. Also, gained knowledge about Google 
  App engine and how to use it with Python and deployed my site there. 
  Skills : Python, Google App Engine, Jinja
